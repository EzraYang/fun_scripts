# About  
This repository is for scripts helping me with chores, no big deal.  
But it would be fun and somehow convenient to upload them here.  

* `kindle_get_note`:   
Extract notes of a single book from kindle's 'My Clippings.txt' file,   
sort by positional order, and export them to a separate .txt file.  

* `rename_file`:  
Clean file names, mostly Coursera lecture PDF.  
Can add separate cleaning functions for other usage.

* `toilet_choosing`:
simulating the situation of choosing the most hygenic toilet
in a music festivel.
A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWib5olGbQ0) about it.
